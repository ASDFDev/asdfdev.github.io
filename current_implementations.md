# Current Implementations


- **Near-ultrasound**: Lecturer is able to communicate with student via near-ultrasound. Students' device will receive a dialog when attendance has been successfully submitted.
- **Device checks**: Students will receive a dialog showing that they have already submitted attendance on the same device twice for the lesson.(Combating attendance fraud)
- **Time based token**: A unique token will be generated by the server for each student that will last for 20 seconds. This prevents replay attacks.(Students recording audio over the air and sending the audio to their friends that are not in class.) 
- **RESTful services to interact with backend**
- **iOS Frontend**
- **Android Frontend**
